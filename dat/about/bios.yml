In addition to design partnering, creating and mentoring, Kyle enjoys time with his toys. If it has a motor and can propel you forward, Kyle can tune on it.

francois:
  name: Francois Dransart
  position: Designer
  summary: While sitting beneath a tree between lectures at France’s Institut Supérieur de Design, Francois was struck on his head by an apple. While rubbing his head, he knew fighting gravity was his true calling and that Astro would be a perfect fit for him, his master’s degree, and his snowboard. If you can pry Francois away from his designing tools you’ll find him hiking, biking or shredding large hills in San Francisco or the nearby Sierras.

astro:
  name: Astronaut Mascot
  position: Mascot
  summary: We found Astro on ebay, where he had penned a beautiful pitch requesting aid in his escape from a dank closet in the middle of Wisconsin.

Although relatively new to the commercial design game, Sean is laying down heavy design and knowledge for some of our top clients. Before designing, Sean was a pro-gamer with lighting thumbs and smoldering retinas. We turned that couch loving energy into a take no prisoners design machine. As long as we translate the design briefs into first person shooter scenarios, Sean excels every time.

kristy:
  name: Kristy Green
  position: Account Manager
  summary: Kristy hails from the University of Illinois where she studied Nutrition, but a few rounds at the hospital quickly squashed the Florence Nightingale right out of her.
