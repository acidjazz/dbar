    - Activities may include meetings, brainstorming, conference calls, networking, and proposals.
      
2:
  title: DEFINE
  copy:
    - As we begin the design work, Astro will create a strong point-of-view by immersing our team in relevant data from clients, competitors, market insights, and usage models to fuel the design process.
    - Activities may include research, demographics, audits, technology reviews, user profiles & user scenarios, engineering & manufacturing reviews.

  title: DESIGN
  copy:
    -	Using the fuel from the Define phase, Astro will create a range of concepts that explore the design and innovation potential by using various communication and design tools over a number of collaborative review sessions.
    -	Activities may include 2D & 3D storyboards, identity concepts, illustrations, CAD models, physical models & prototypes.
4:
  title: DEVELOP
  copy:
    - Often overlapping with the Design phase, Astro will collaborate with implementation resources like engineering, manufacturing, printing, and coding, to guide and subsequently transfer the chosen direction into production.
    -	Activities may include 2D/3D CAD development, color, materials & finishes specification files, packaging, out-of-box experiences, UI/UX refinement and interaction guidance.
5:
  title: DEPLOY
  copy:
    - Astro will help advocate and realize the original vision of the program into full commercialization mode with chosen resources and partners.
    -	Activities might include part, product or print reviews, manufacturer visits, sales, advertising or retail support.
