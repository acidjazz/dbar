  description: The updated color ways for Minus 8's Layer 24 collection have just dropped in.  In this follow up collection, we were inspired by bold color blocking, and userd the unique layer construction to create new, unexpected color and material finish separations in the case.  New details include various enamel and lume-filled branded etching which adds depth to smooth case geometry.  Look for new Minus 8 watch models soon.
