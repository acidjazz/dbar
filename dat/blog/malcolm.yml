  description: Airbrush painting has long lived in mall kiosks, county fair booths and/or street fairs.  Malcolm Stuart is keeping this art form in thrive-mode working out his loft in Oakland painting his perfect mix of pop and beauty.  Malcolm got his MFA at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.  Shortly after graduating he didn't really know what his next step would be, so he started an airbrush apprenticeship at a shop in Green Acres Mall in Jamaica, Queens called Art of Your Mind.
