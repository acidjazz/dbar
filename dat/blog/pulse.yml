  description: Motorola just released the Astro designed Moto Pulse on-ear headphones.  These cans boast 40mm speaker drivers and bluetooth connectivity up to 60 feet.  The battery also lasts up to 18 hours on a single charge.  Yes they look awesome, yes they sound killer, but the real lure just may be their affordability.  $59.99 out the door!  The Pulse comes in two colors to choose from, black and chalk.
