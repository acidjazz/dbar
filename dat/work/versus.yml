    title: GETTING AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION
    copy: As training techniques at all levels become more sophisticated and the stakes continue to increase, athletes are looking in new places for a competitive edge. For many, the mind is the final frontier and elite athletes must train their mind as rigorously as they train their bodies.

    copy: "After we named the parent company: Sense Labs, we named and designed the Versus brand and headset to appeal to athletes' sense of competition while doing justice to the serious science behind the experience. Striking a harmonious balance between science and sport resulted in purpose-driven, precise engineering with a performance aesthetic, which sits at the crossroads of the lab and the arena."

  body3: 
    copy: We were challenged to create the Versus headset to be attractive enough to pass the mirror test while also being high-performance enough to work effectively on an extreme range of head sizes.

  body4:
    copy: We did this by combining heat-welded 3D mesh fabric used in athletic footwear with an ultra-lightweight headphone structure. The soft X-frame flexes to fit on the wearer's head while the sensors make contact independently allowing for micro fit adjustments.
