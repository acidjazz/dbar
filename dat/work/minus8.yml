    title: CONSTRUCTING A BRAND BIT-BY-BIT
    copy: "We created MINUS-8 to scratch our entrepreneurial itch and to give ourselves the chance to design for our toughest client: us. Free to pursue our wilder impulses but bound by our exacting standards, we combined the best materials and production methods with a modern machine aesthetic that embraces experimentation to create a totally unique line of watches."

    left: The MINUS-8 brand is inspired by California's eight-hour distance from Greenwich Mean Time. We believe the West Coastâ€™s position as a bit of an outsider gives us the freedom to be innovators and change-agents. The progressive, layered construction makes MINUS-8 as future-focused in its aesthetic as it is in its ethos.

    title: THE LAYER SERIES
    copy: The Layer Series are the brand's flagship models. These designs feature layers of stacked, machined parts that combine with multiple colorways and finishes to create custom builds, while maintaining MINUS-8's timeless nature.
