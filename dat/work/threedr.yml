    title: A DRONE FOR EVERYONE
    copy1: Our biggest challenge was designing the drone to appeal to and inspire hard-core enthusiasts and casual users alike.  Positioning the Solo on the cutting-edge of the lifestyle-technology intersection demanded we create a bold yet user-friendly look. The hazards of flight also insisted we use durable materials that would protect the Soloâ€™s advanced technology.

  body3:
    left: We worked to make the Solo's intelligence accessible to users of all levels. To that end, we created a controller with intuitive user interactions that also featured a revolutionary heads-up video display.
    right: The result is a fully integrated consumer experience that has positioned 3D Robotics to be a leader in the growing consumer video drone market.
