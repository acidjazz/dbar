    title: TV HAS CHANGED
    copy: "In the past, TV choices were limited to broadcast networks. Later, cable channels created hundreds of choices. Now, with the addition of streaming and on-demand services, choice is nearly unlimited -- creating a new problem: finding something to watch. Jinni partnered with Astro to develop an information design language and UX model that made their technology functionally friendly."

    title: NEW UX PRINCIPLES
    copy: "Our goal in creating a next generation TV entertainment experience was simple: create an enjoyable experience that gets you to great content faster, using Jinni’s unique Entertainment Genome to find the best content for you."

    title: REDUCE CHOICE
    copy: "To make the experience less stressful, we reduced choice at any moment. Large grids of thumbnails were replaced with short lists, never containing more than 5 choices on a screen at once."

    title: TUBES
    copy: "Jinni’s Entertainment Genome creates the best possible connection between content. We leveraged this in a deceptively simple idea: allow any piece of content to be a gateway to more titles like it, leading to a fluid discovery experience."

  body3:
    left: Using Jinni's Entertainment Genome technology as a starting point, we designed a user discovery experience that allows viewers to discover the content they want, before they know they want it, without ever having to punch in a frustratingly long show title into a search bar.
    right: The result was an intuitive and visually compelling experience that allowed viewers to navigate a novel content hierarchy and cover more relevant information than ever.
