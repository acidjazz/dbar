  body1: 
    title: CALIFORNIA INSPIRED
    copy: Electric is a California action-sports brand to the core. We were tasked with creating a goggle with a radical new look that would inspire their loyal base. The result was the EG3 -- a totally unique-looking snow goggle with some serious functional improvements.

  callout: 
    copy: We designed the EG3 to be an evolution of Electric's classic EG2 goggle.

  body2:
    copy: The design preserves the EG2's iconic, sharp shape, but removes the lens frame, allowing the lens to run to the edge for maximum visibility and a futuristic look. The EG3â€™s design also integrates their signature quick-change lens feature while including details like fading perforations for a totally original result.
