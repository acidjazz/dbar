  body1:
    title: DRILLING INTO THE BRAND
    copy: We started by naming the company. Mineralist lets everyday people (or mineral-rights owners) and high-stakes business people (or energy-industry lessees) collaborate. So we needed to have a name that reflected a spirit of cooperation. We believe we struck gold with the approachable Mineralist.

  body2: 
    copy: The Mineralist name served a clever second purpose of being a description of the user interface -- Mineralist is literally a list of minerals available for the energy industry to lease.

  callout: 
    copy: The visual identity reflects the coming together of the two parties, resulting in an oil drop.
